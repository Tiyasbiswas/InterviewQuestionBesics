## Q18-Make The String Great
Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters.
A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where:0 <= i <= s.length - 2
s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.
To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.
Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

##--------------------------------------------------ALGORITHEM------------------------------------------------

## Q1-Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] arr); }

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.

Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
